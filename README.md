# TOP-members-only

My implementation of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) "members only" project.

## Usage

1. In `./server`, rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Open that file and fill in the empty strings.
3. Still in `./server`, execute `npm run dev` and visit `localhost:3000` in a web browser.
